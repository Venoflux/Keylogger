# Keylogger
Educational toy keylogger project written in Python

Caution, for educational purposes only. It is a Python script that activates the keylogger and with an email bot that sends the email with the given time gap in seconds.
Right now no real emails typed into the script and names changed with obvious names to make user sure they are infected.
